Enhanced Liquidity Infrastructure: \n   - By offering a single-sided AMM for stablecoins, Cheetah boosts liquidity across the Sei blockchain, making it easier for developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) that require stable, deep liquidity pools. This benefits projects like DeFi platforms, lending protocols, and NFT marketplaces.\n   \n2. Composable Smart Contracts:\n   - Cheetah’s smart contracts can be integrated into other dApps or protocols within the Sei ecosystem. Developers can leverage our liquidity pools, token swaps, and low-slippage features to enhance their own platforms, saving time and resources that would otherwise be spent building liquidity mechanisms from scratch.\n\n3. Developer-Friendly Tools & APIs:\n   - Cheetah provides open APIs and SDKs that allow developers to easily access and integrate Cheetah's liquidity pools, swaps, and data into their own projects. This empowers developers to innovate more efficiently and scale their products on Sei.\n   \n4. Censorship Resistance & Security Focus:\n   - The protocol prioritizes security, decentralization, and self-custody, which aligns with the ethos of the Sei ecosystem. Developers can rely on Cheetah's robust infrastructure when building applications that require strong user protections and censorship resistance.\n   \n5. Ecosystem Synergy:\n   - By attracting users and liquidity to Sei, Cheetah helps foster a vibrant ecosystem. This increases overall activity on the blockchain, providing greater exposure and user base for other developers building on Sei.\n",

We’re done airdrops with other communities for them and ours. We’re working on something now with some other developers and artists to make something special on the EVM side. At least once a week we get a question related to something to do with a smart contract or website and we try to go above just answering and show live examples for the solutions/solve the solutions ourself for them even. There’s a lot we’ve done and a lot more we plan to do as we continue making sei great. Fredo (the other founder of seivians) was talking with some other founders about starting a “class” almost for developing most things nft related as well as other things (art, setting up sites/services (such as discord servers, telegram groups, etc.) I have a few years of experience taking game design classes years ago as well.",

Each project will have detailed documentation in one centralized location, making it easier for developers and users alike to explore and engage with SEI projects.\n\nPrice Tracker: We will integrate a tool that allows users to track real-time prices, token appreciation, contract addresses, circulating supply, and more—without needing to rely on external platforms like CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap. This tool will be tailored specifically for SEI assets, providing in-depth data at a glance.\n\nNFT Tracker: For NFT traders, we will offer a specialized section that tracks floor prices, volume, and trending NFTs.

This will show other developers how to bring real-world use cases onto the blockchain, highlighting the ease of transitioning to web3. How? A. Create a discount system for users who use sei to make purchases, i.e create a smart contract that handles transactions and interacts with my web2 which handles store of payment made. B. Coupons system that can be converted to sei token which can be used for in app purchases or outside the app. C. Affiliate system built of smart contract and rewarded in sei currency increasing the interactions with the chain. E. The most significant mile stone is creating a utils coin that's associated with a start up the mechanism will be based on the traditional IPO system now, small startup can get a chance to experience the system without the hassle of a regular IPO, but this will be regulated by the users, companies valuation and other factors (future milestone) \nAll this is aimed at incentivising start-up to adopt the system seamlessly as all the smart contract and steps created with be made public we we integrate it in our system. \nCase 2: teechar is an AI course generator, we plan on training our models with sei documentations to aid it in creating tailored educational solutions in Matter of seconds, then to have people keep to the initial goal we'll create rewards (in sei) associated with accomplishments.

This increases the reach and liquidity of the Sei ecosystem, creating new opportunities for developers.\nSei Token Usage: We offer our users the possibility to earn Sei tokens in exchange for some advertisements. This strengthens the token economy by expanding the circulation and usage of Sei tokens.\nAttracting New Users: Through our advertising platform, we attract users who are not yet familiar with cryptocurrency and blockchain to the Sei ecosystem. This accelerates new user acquisition for Sei.\nDeFi Integration: We incentivise users to use their earned Sei tokens in DeFi protocols on Sei. This contributes to the growth of the DeFi ecosystem on Sei.\nSmart Contract Development: By developing custom smart contracts on Sei, we are moving some of the functionality of our platform to the Sei blockchain. This enriches Sei's smart contract ecosystem.\nData Analytics Tools: We are making the tools we have developed to measure the performance of adverts available to Sei developers. This helps to develop more effective dApps on Sei.\nCommunity Building: By including solΦ users in the Sei ecosystem, we contribute to the growth and diversification of the Sei community.\nEducation and Awareness: By providing educational content about Sei and its features through our platform, we enable users to learn about Sei technology.\nSei Validator Incentive: We encourage our users to stake their earned Sei tokens and support Sei validators. This increases the security and decentralisation of the Sei network.\nInnovative Usage Scenarios: Our advertising and privacy-focused solution inspires other developers by offering innovative use cases on Sei.\n\nWith these integrations and contributions, the solΦ project actively contributes to the growth, diversification and strengthening of the Sei ecosystem\n\n",

        "answer": "Our solΦ project combines advertising technology with the blockchain world, adopting Sei's innovative features and vision. Here's how our project aligns with Sei's key features:\n\nParallel Execution:\nsolΦ leverages Sei's parallel execution feature to manage high volumes of ad transactions. This enables our platform to process many ad campaigns simultaneously and quickly record user interactions. In particular, we increase the scalability and performance of our system by executing ad impressions, clicks and reward distributions in parallel.\nTwin Turbo Consensus:\nSei's fast consensus mechanism allows solΦ to implement real-time ad auctions and dynamic pricing models. In this way, advertisers can instantly reach their target audience and quickly adapt their advertising strategies. Furthermore, the ability to distribute rewards to users instantly significantly improves the user experience of our platform.\nSeiDB:\nSeiDB's high-performance data storage and querying capabilities allow solΦ to effectively manage large data sets such as user profiles, ad performance metrics and reward history. This helps us deliver more accurate targeting options to advertisers and personalised ad experiences to users. We also leverage SeiDB's security features for privacy-protected data analytics.\nVM Interoperability:\nSei's interoperability with different virtual machines allows solΦ to integrate into various blockchain ecosystems. This allows our project to manage advertising campaigns and token rewards on Ethereum, Solana and other major blockchains. For example, we can manage the advertisement of an NFT project on Ethereum through Sei and distribute rewards on different blockchains.\nSecurity and Stability:\nSei's strong security features play a critical role in protecting solΦ's user data and advertising budgets. In particular, by integrating our zk-compression technology with Sei's security protocols, we maximise user privacy.\nScalability:\nSei's high throughput capacity enables solΦ to serve millions of users and advertisers on a global scale. This supports our project's growth ambitions and allows us to make a large-scale impact on the advertising industry.\nLow Transaction Fees:\nSei's low transaction fees allow solΦ to economically manage micropayments and small-scale advertising campaigns. This incentivises small businesses and individual content producers to use our platform.\n",

        "answer": "Our project adds significant value to the Sei developer ecosystem through several initiatives:\n\n- Developer Education: We offer free, easy-to-understand courses specifically tailored for developers at different skill levels. For instance, one of our courses teaches developers how to set up and mint NFTs on Sei using Webump’s Lighthouse. This empowers developers to quickly onboard and start utilizing Sei’s infrastructure, fostering growth in the ecosystem.\n\n- On-Chain Activities: Through interactive assignments and quizzes, such as uploading transaction hashes or screenshots, we actively encourage developers to engage in on-chain activities. This not only helps developers gain practical experience but also drives more transactions and activity to the Sei blockchain.\n\n- Sei-Specific Resources: We are building a library of SEO-optimized articles focused on Sei, which help developers understand the technical advantages and opportunities within the network. Topics include Sei’s parallel execution model and its MEV protection, which are significant innovations that developers can leverage in their projects.\n\n- Community Engagement: Our Jobs channel in Discord connects Web3 developers with opportunities specifically within the Sei ecosystem, facilitating career growth and building a strong network of developers around Sei.\n\nThese initiatives contribute to a more informed, engaged, and active developer community on Sei, which in turn strengthens the ecosystem by encouraging innovation and increasing on-chain activity.",

        "answer": "Our strength lies in our content creation, and we continuously leverage this to engage and build a strong community within the Sei ecosystem. Here’s how we’re enhancing our efforts:\n\nRegular Skits for Community Engagement: Our skits creatively highlight notable projects and activities in the Sei community. For example, in our upcoming video scheduled for October 5, we’ll feature two of the top-performing memecoins—BOOBLE and GONAD. The same video will showcase Seipex’s new memecoin launchpad, which we’re promoting as the fairest memecoin launchpad on Sei. Through fun and relatable content like this, we aim to build connections with other projects while increasing engagement and brand recognition.\n\nStrategic Giveaways: Giveaways are a key part of our strategy for driving engagement and expanding our community. Recently, we gave away a Colony NFT and GONAD tokens, which helped us attract new followers. These events created a buzz and will continue as we distribute more of the NFTs and memecoins we’ve acquired, fostering deeper engagement and expanding our audience reach.\n\nOnly on Sei Podcast: Our Only on Sei podcast focuses on speaking with key builders on Sei, allowing us to grow our community and enhance our credibility as thought leaders and educators in the space. These interviews give the audience valuable insights into Sei’s ecosystem and drive ongoing community engagement.\n\nActive Participation in AMAs and Spaces: We also engage directly with the Sei community by participating in AMAs and speaking on Spaces. For instance, our founder was recently a guest on the Sei Minties Discord server, where he discussed NFTs on Sei and DeFi. His participation drew a sizable audience, and by asking questions and giving away a Minties NFT and 200 $JLY tokens, we reinforced our presence within the community. We plan to continue attending and speaking at such events, as they help to build connections and grow our visibility.\n\nThese strategic content and community initiatives position us as a central player in the Sei ecosystem, driving both engagement and education while continuously growing our audience.",

        "answer": "Our team’s collective expertise is key to the successful execution of our project on Sei. Here's a breakdown of how each member's skills contribute to the project:\n\n- Strategy and Leadership: Our founder, Admiano, is a visionary with extensive experience in strategy, project management, and marketing. As the head of strategy at Seitastic, Admiano plays a pivotal role in defining the project’s roadmap, including the development of content, marketing, and educational initiatives. His strong leadership helps align the team’s efforts toward long-term success.\n\n- Content Creation and Community Engagement: Khamlijay serves as our content creator and social media manager. She is a core member of the team and hosts the \"Sei Lexicon\" series, where she breaks down key Sei terminologies as well as explaining the tech that powers the network in a fun, interactive, and educative way. With a deep understanding of social media dynamics, she engages effectively with the community, boosting awareness and fostering meaningful interactions across platforms.\n\n- Tabitha, our head of community and content creator, is equally essential. She manages community relationships, ensuring that our content is relatable and tailored to the Sei audience. Together, Khamlijay and Tabitha create innovative skits, podcasts, and community initiatives that keep our audience engaged.\n\n- Technical Expertise: On the technical front, we have a dedicated team working on the developer resources and course materials for Sei. The developer we recently brought on board created tutorials that simplify the process of minting NFTs using Webump's Lighthouse, ensuring that both developers and entry-level coders can leverage Sei’s tools. This technical foundation is critical in creating valuable content that addresses real developer pain points and boosts engagement with Sei's infrastructure.\n\nOur team's combined skills in content creation, strategy, and technical development ensure that we can successfully deliver projects, build a thriving community, and provide the necessary resources for developers and users in the Sei ecosystem.

        "answer": "Our project is an ongoing initiative that has consistently contributed to the Sei ecosystem in several impactful ways. Here's a breakdown of our key contributions:\n\n- Educational Content: We've developed a wide range of courses, tutorials, and explainer videos tailored to both developers and users interested in the Sei Network. For example, our most recent course guides users on how to mint NFTs on Sei using Webump's Lighthouse, making the process accessible even to those with entry-level coding skills. By providing high-quality, SEO-optimized content on our dedicated blog, we help drive traffic and increase awareness of Sei’s unique infrastructure and capabilities.\n\nCommunity Engagement: Through our Only on Sei podcast, we interview key figures in the ecosystem, from developers to project leaders. These podcasts offer insights into the projects being built on Sei and educate the broader community. The podcast series not only boosts community engagement but also enhances Sei’s reputation as a robust and innovative platform. We also actively participate in AMAs, collaborate with other projects, and conduct giveaways to foster community spirit.\n\nSEO-Optimized Articles: As a solution to the challenges we faced with Binance Feed, we launched our own dedicated blog where we can freely write about Sei and its ecosystem without restrictions. This platform allows us to publish in-depth, SEO-optimized articles that are more visible to potential users and developers who are searching for educational resources and project updates.\n\nPartnerships and Promotion: By showcasing various memecoins and projects like Seipex's memecoin launchpad in our skits and videos, we contribute to the visibility and success of emerging projects on the network. Our content strengthens ties between different communities and promotes collaboration within the ecosystem.\n\nGiveaways: We actively conduct giveaways to boost community interaction and attract new members. We have given away several NFTs including Colony, Minties, Crafty Cannies, and others. And we have done some memecoin giveaways as well. These events serve as a fun, engaging way to grow our audience and expand the reach of the Sei ecosystem.\n\nOverall, our ongoing efforts have consistently supported the growth and engagement of the Sei community, ensuring that both developers and users have the resources and insights needed to thrive on the platform.",

This setup will allow us to produce a consistent stream of high-quality content, ranging from educational videos to entertaining skits that highlight the strengths of Sei.\n\nWhether or not this application is successful, we are fully committed to this course of action. We’re confident that, within 4-6 months, the Sei Foundation will be able to clearly see, track, and appreciate our valuable contributions to the Sei ecosystem.

Instead of building new games, we focus on creating casual, educational content and interactive experiences that introduce gamers to Sei in a fun and accessible way.\nSpecific Examples of Our Content:\n“SEI Play Sessions” Video Series: This flagship series will feature Couch Gaming team members and special guests playing through different SEI-based games, explaining game mechanics, tips, and the overall experience in real-time. Each session will cover a different game, highlighting unique features and strategies to help players feel more comfortable jumping in. For example, if a new trading card game launches on SEI, we’ll showcase a full walkthrough, cover deck-building tips, and provide commentary to help viewers learn the game effortlessly.\n“Let’s Talk Tactics” Breakdown Videos: These shorter, focused videos will break down complex gaming strategies into simple, digestible segments. Imagine a strategy game with multiple units and complex interactions—“Let’s Talk Tactics” will help players master the basics and build confidence. This series will serve as a quick reference for players who want to get better without sifting through hours of tutorials.\nInteractive Tournaments and Challenges: Couch Gaming will host regular casual tournaments and in-game challenges for both new and experienced players. For example, we might run a “Speedrun Challenge” for an action RPG, where the goal is to complete a dungeon in the fastest time. These events will have a casual, welcoming atmosphere, where the focus is more on learning and having fun rather than winning.\n“Game Guides & Deep Dives”: We will create detailed, step-by-step game guides for new titles, explaining everything from setting up a SEI wallet to advanced game strategies. Each guide will include visuals, gameplay footage, and real-world analogies to make complex blockchain concepts more relatable. For example, a guide for a new SEI-based MMORPG would cover everything from character creation to understanding the game’s economic systems.\n",

Our community engagement approach is centered around creating spaces where everyone feels comfortable—whether they’re long-time blockchain gamers or completely new to Web3.\nCommunity Engagement Strategies:\nLive Play-Along Sessions: We’ll host regular live streams where players can join us in real-time, ask questions, and even participate in the gameplay. For example, during a “New Game Showcase” live stream, viewers can suggest strategies, ask about game mechanics, or even vote on the next moves we should make.\nPlayer Spotlights: We’ll highlight community members who have achieved something noteworthy—like mastering a game’s economy or reaching a new level of expertise. These player spotlights will not only celebrate the community’s achievements but also serve as educational content for others.\nWeekly Polls and Community Voting: To ensure that the community feels involved, we’ll run regular polls on Twitter and Discord to decide which games or topics we should cover next. For example, if a new game launches on SEI, we might ask: “Should our next video be a full walkthrough, a strategy guide, or a review?” This keeps our content aligned with what the community wants to see.\nEvent Recaps & Highlights: After hosting a tournament or a live Q&A, we’ll produce highlight videos and summaries, sharing key moments, funny interactions, and the community’s feedback. These will be posted across social media, ensuring that even those who couldn’t attend can catch up.\n",

Developers will have access to pre-built modules, smart contract templates, and debugging tools that accelerate the dApp development process. This enables developers to focus on building innovative applications rather than spending excessive time on setup or blockchain integration. The SDK also lowers technical barriers, allowing developers from other ecosystems or with less blockchain experience to easily adopt SEI, which will ultimately expand the pool of developers working within the SEI ecosystem.\nFor example:\nPre-built Modules: These include wallet integration, SEI token transactions, and API connections for faster dApp development.\nSmart Contract Templates: Ready-made templates for common use cases such as token issuance, NFT minting, and decentralized finance (DeFi) operations.\nDebugging Tools: Tools that help developers troubleshoot and optimize their smart contracts before deployment, ensuring fewer errors and more efficient contracts on SEI.\nBy providing these tools, the SEI SDK will speed up project development timelines, leading to a rapid increase in the number of applications and services built on SEI.\n",

This will cover beginner-level content for new developers as well as advanced use cases for experienced developers looking to push the limits of the SEI blockchain.\nCommunity Contributions: We aim to foster a collaborative development environment. The SDK will be open-sourced, allowing the community to contribute improvements, suggest new features, or report issues. Community feedback will directly influence future updates to the SDK.\nSocial Media and Developer Forums: Regular posts on Twitter, GitHub, Discord, and other channels will keep the community informed about updates, new features, and tutorials.

Without a deep grasp of the projects or their culture, they are easily influenced by FOMO and show little loyalty. They're quick to move their funds elsewhere at the first sign of a better opportunity\nI have solution for this problem and I think I'm doing good  : \nI create educational content to enhance users' understanding of Sei. For example, a project that I launched in July with my team is a weekly livestream series about Sei, discussing ways to earn money from Sei. This campaign attracts over 500 listeners each week. It helps new users gain knowledge about the project, as well as better understand the features of the system's Dapps. For instance, not only can they hold Sei for profit, but they can also stake and farm on various Dapps, or invest in promising NFTs, etc. Additionally, I continue to create daily content for the channel, updating information about Sei and opportunities for airdrops from projects built on Sei\n",

Specifically, we hypothesize that after receiving training on crop selection, soil management, water conservation, and financial literacy including the use of digital savings tools and cryptocurrency, women will demonstrate improved planning skills and financial management practices.\nTo measure the success of our hypothesis, we will track the following Key Performance Indicator (KPI):\n  At least 80% of the participating women saving groups will demonstrate an increase in their ability to plan for agricultural seasons effectively.\nData to measure this KPI will be collected through endline user surveys conducted by our pilot partners. These surveys will assess the women's understanding of sustainable agriculture practices, their adoption of digital financial tools for savings, and their confidence in planning ahead for farming seasons. By analyzing the survey results, we aim to evaluate the impact of our educational interventions on the planning capabilities and financial management skills of rural women groups\n",

By rewarding\n\nfarmers who save $20 on their crypto wallets and those practicing regenerative agriculture\n\nwith organic manure, we create a direct financial incentive for sustainable practices. This not\n\nonly encourages environmentally friendly farming techniques but also promotes financial\n\ninclusion and literacy among rural communities.\n\nBlockchain technology is essential for ensuring transparency, security, and immutability in\n\nthese reward systems. Through blockchain, we can track and verify transactions securely,\n\nguaranteeing that rewards are distributed fairly and efficiently. The decentralized nature of\n\nblockchain also eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing trust\n\namong participants.\n\nA traditional or Web2 solution would fall short in providing the same level of transparency,\n\nsecurity, and efficiency that blockchain offers. Without blockchain technology, tracking\n\nrewards and ensuring their proper distribution could be prone to errors, delays, or even\n\nmanipulation. Additionally, the decentralized nature of Web3 allows for greater autonomy and\n\ncontrol over financial transactions compared to traditional centralized systems.\n\nBy leveraging crypto/Web3 technology and blockchain in our project, we not only enhance the\n\neffectiveness of our reward mechanisms but also pave the way for a more inclusive and secure\n\nfinancial ecosystem for rural communities.

This ensures that story submissions, token rewards, and community interactions happen in real-time, creating a smooth and seamless experience for users without delays.\n\nTwin Turbo Consensus: By utilizing SEI’s Twin Turbo consensus, SEISHORTS ensures rapid finality and low-latency transactions, which is crucial for our dynamic SHORTIES token system. Users can engage with the platform without worrying about long confirmation times, keeping the interaction fluid and efficient.\n\nSeiDB: SEISHORTS can tap into SeiDB’s ability to manage large datasets with speed and efficiency. With a growing library of user-generated content and metadata, SeiDB’s structure ensures that story retrieval, browsing happen swiftly, enhancing user satisfaction.\n\nVM Interoperability: SEISHORTS aims to integrate with other ecosystems in the future, and SEI’s VM Interoperability allows us to potentially expand beyond SEI while maintaining compatibility with various blockchains.

This version will be like an interactive FAQ but tailored to newbies. It will cover the basics of Sei: how to set up a wallet, obtain tokens, and interact with simple smart contracts.\n   - Bug reporting and issue tracking will be integrated into this early phase.\n\n2. Phase 2 – \"Smart Contracts Development \" (Month 2-3):**  \n   - Start developing smart contracts that the bot will reference. The contracts will be designed to showcase Sei’s unique features while remaining easy for users to understand. (Or at least, as easy as possible for a larping dev like me!)\n\n3. Phase 3 – Advanced Features (Month 4+): \n   - Introduce features for power users who want to go beyond the basics: staking, governance participation, and more complex smart contract interaction.\n   - Expand the bot’s capabilities to also report on key Sei ecosystem updates and new developer tools.\n\nmy goal is to create something impactful and fun that aligns with Sei's vision—even if I’m learning as I go. I already have the Bot in progress and currently filling in the information for privacy policy and command. As soon as this is completed, Phase one should be on and it would only get better from there.",

It’s impressive that sei is the fastest network on the blockchain, with a one cent trade fee, though few still know about it.

In addition, make as much content video possible with educational pieces about all these topics on sei network, and more. Although Seis AI is a simple launch on seiyan.fun, I tried to utilize it into making it more of a smart contract, in wanting to create value for holders, and have options for them to vote through a DAO with how to best use Seis tokens to help seis go mainstream through exchanges, and other platforms.

We utilize SEI’s cutting-edge infrastructure to provide a seamless, fast-paced, and competitive gaming experience.\n\nParallel Execution: SEI’s parallel execution is vital to our TCG, where real-time gameplay requires multiple simultaneous actions. Whether players are buying, selling, or trading cards, or engaging in live matches with complex interactions, SEI’s ability to process multiple transactions concurrently ensures that the gameplay remains fluid and free of delays, even during high-traffic events such as tournaments.\n\nTwin Turbo Consensus: Fast finality is critical in a trading card game, especially when players are engaging in competitive matches or trading high-value cards. SEI’s Twin Turbo Consensus ensures that in-game actions, card trades, and marketplace transactions are confirmed instantly. This guarantees a frictionless experience, critical to attracting Web2 users who expect instantaneous gameplay and transaction feedback.\n\nSeiDB: As a TCG, the game requires efficient data handling to manage player collections, deck-building, match outcomes, and ranking systems. SeiDB’s performance at scale allows us to track in-game assets, player stats, and card ownership efficiently, even as the user base grows. This ensures that player progress is always recorded in real-time and can be accessed with minimal latency, enhancing user experience and engagement.\n\nVM Interoperability: The interoperable nature of SEI’s VM allows us to bring players from other blockchains into the SEI ecosystem. This includes enabling cross-chain asset transfers, where players can integrate cards or tokens from other networks into their SEI-based collection. This fosters a wider player base and makes the in-game economy more dynamic, encouraging users from multiple ecosystems to participate and engage with SEI’s unique gaming environment.\n\nBy leveraging SEI’s core features, BankSEI TCG will deliver a fast, scalable, and inclusive trading card game experience. The combination of real-time gameplay, instant transactions, and cross-chain compatibility aligns directly with SEI’s vision, driving broader adoption of the SEI network while providing an engaging experience for both Web2 and blockchain-native players.",
