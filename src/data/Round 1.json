Admiano's deep understanding of the network and longstanding reputation as one of the SEI ecosystem's OG figures make him a true asset.\n\nStrategic partnerships with leading Sei projects are a cornerstone of Seitastic's future.

        "answer": "🔸Reward-Driven Learning:  Our course platform goes beyond traditional education by incorporating a gamified approach. Users earn points for completing activities within the courses. These points unlock new courses and, ultimately, opportunities to earn NFTs and tokens of SEI projects. This incentivizes active participation, deepens user understanding, and fosters a culture of continuous learning within the SEI community.\n\n💡Example: A user diligently completes one of our beginner courses and receives points. These points unlock an intermediate course on using applications built on Sei. Upon successful completion of the intermediate course, the user becomes eligible for a token/NFT airdrop from a partnered project or from our treasury.\n\n🔸Enhanced User Engagement:  The gamified approach with point accumulation and reward opportunities keeps users engaged with the learning process. This sustained engagement is crucial for building a strong foundation of knowledge among Sei users.\n\n🔸Hands-on Learning: Our courses don't just focus on theory. They often integrate practical exercises that guide users through the process of using real Sei applications. This empowers users to confidently navigate the network and leverage its functionalities.\n\n💡Example: A course on minting NFTs on Sei includes a guided walkthrough of a popular NFT minting platform within the Sei ecosystem. Users can directly apply their learnings to create and potentially sell their own NFTs.\n\n🔸Positive Sentiment Reinforcement:  Our visual and text content sheds light on the positive developments happening within the SEI ecosystem. This focus on positive news and upcoming opportunities helps to cultivate optimism and excitement among Sei community members.",

At this stage we would be testing our initial smart contracts, and frontend for any flaws or issues as well as getting feed back from users regarding the actual usability of the platform. This is a wide range due to the fact that most of the project development can be done by myself, however hiring a trusted dev on upwork could rapidly speed up development time and could increase the costs slightly if more developers are needed..\n\n(2 - 4 weeks / up to 8 weeks) / 5k - 10k\nPhase two would be implement those changes and get a quick round of feedback. At this stage we would also be considering looking at any audits for the smart contract and frontend / backend to see any flaws that might have been overlooked and security issues. The largest single expense at this stage would be the audits. Depending on the auditing firm, this can be an expensive part of the project.\n\n(1 - 3 weeks) / 5k\nPhase three would be to implement any additional changes needed due to the audit and final round of feedback. We would launch the marketplace and go live for buying and selling. The funding at this stage would be used all on marketing to push the awareness of the project. This might include selective influencers for popular NFTs on various chains. \n\n\nThese are worst case scenarios, however also very realistic projections at the same time.

However, here are some common strategies meme-coin projects might use to drive user adoption and participation:\n\nCommunity Building:\n\nActive Social Media Presence: Engaging with users on Twitter, Telegram, Discord, or other popular platforms can foster a sense of community and excitement.\nMemes and Contests: Leveraging the meme-coin aspect with funny content and contests can attract new users and keep existing users engaged.\nCollaborations: Partnering with other Sei ecosystem projects or influencers can expand reach and attract new audiences.\nIncentivization Programs:\n\nAirdrops: Distributing free $BALLZ tokens to early adopters or users who complete specific actions can incentivize participation.\nStaking Rewards: Offering rewards for locking up $BALLZ tokens for a certain period can attract users seeking passive income.\nYield Farming: Integrating $BALLZ with DeFi applications on Sei could allow users to earn rewards through liquidity pools or other DeFi activities.\nUtility and Functionality:\n\nGovernance Rights: As mentioned before, $BALLZ holders might be granted voting rights on Sei network proposals, increasing their stake in the ecosystem.\nPayments or Fees: If $BALLZ is used for paying transaction fees or accessing specific services within the Sei ecosystem, it directly increases its utility and user adoption.\nUnique Features: Some meme-coins offer unique features or functionalities beyond just being a tradable token. See if there are any announcements about such features for SeiBallz.\nTransparency and Communication:\n\nClear Roadmap: Having a well-defined roadmap that outlines the project's goals and development timeline can build trust and attract users who believe in the project's vision.\nRegular Updates: Keeping the community informed about progress, upcoming events, and new features is essential for maintaining user engagement.\nIt's important to remember that the success of these initiatives depends on their execution and the overall value proposition of SeiBallz.",

Seigami takes the art of a NFT collection and \"Seigamifies\" it which is essentially turning the original art into an origami art style while maintaining the original look. This new collection becomes a low supply collection and is airdropped to Seigami owners and partnered collection owners. This allows two communities that had no plans in crossing paths now come together. Users who own this Seigamified collection are eligible to access Seigami holder utility tools. This incentive allows users to join the discord and create new relationships with new people in the SEI Ecosystem. \n\nSeigami's Growing Bank Mechanism also gives back to holders in the SEI community. The Growing Bank allows for a minimum value to be set on each Seigami NFT depending the amount in the Growing Bank. This allows users to get back a minimum SEI amount if NFT volume extremely slows down in the future. ",

        "answer": "Seigami is an ongoing project that minted on March 15, 2024. During our pre-mint we released no roadmap on what our plans were as we didn't want to over promise before launching. Since launching we have: \n\n- Art Collaborated with SEI NFT collections\n   - Seigami did a test run with the collection UOU (before they rugged, shame on them) to see how our holders and the SEI Ecosystem would react. The reactions that we received made us realize that art collabs were a perfect fit for Seigami. We then were lucky enough to art collab with Seitoshi, REMO, and DOB NFTs first sub dao NAKED YETI CLUB. Our next art collab was halted as we opened an application for a new collection where we \"Seigamify\" users PFP into an NFT. Unfortunately we did not proceed with the collection since we did not have enough entries from the users in the SEI Ecosystem. After this decision, SEI V2 transition was on the way so we will be continuing art collabs within the next few weeks. \n\n- Released 4 utility tools\n   - Seigami teased 2 tools pre-mint to see how discord users would react. Our users loved our tools especially our Metadata tool which allows users to snipe the rarity of NFTs during mint. When mint day came along, those tools became holder exclusive. Since then we have released two new tools totaling of 4 utility tools for our holders (we have 5 but the mint schedule is pulled from calendart.io). Our tools include metadata, price alert, whale tracker, and sweeps monitor. These tools have helped users efficiently trade and be able to secure some rare NFTs for collectors and flippers. \n\n- Donated to Opal Charity\n   - Jay the co-founder of Sei Labs donated his Opal #69 to be raffled off to one lucky ticket holder for Taiwan Earthquake Relief Fund. Seigami donated 275 SEI to the fund and 5 NFTs from our 4 collections (4 at the time, 5 now) to be raffled off to ticket holders. Shoutout to the Opal Team for organizing an amazing event and getting a bunch of SEI communities together. ",

        "answer": "- Art Collabs\n   - We will continue to provide art collabs every 2 to 3 weeks for our holders. There is no timetable on this since this will be a continuous airdrop to holders. \n\n- Utility Tools\n   - We currently have 4 utility tools and plan to push out more depending on what holders want\n   - Current plans are to release two more tools as of now which will be a Trait Listing Tool that will allow users to get notified when certain traits get listed and a Rarity Monitor tool that will notify users when a rare NFT gets listed (for example a top 10 or a top 100 NFT gets listed)\n\n- Growing Bank Mechanism\n   - Our Growing Bank is our main utility tool since it gives back to our users and allows them to always have a minimum value on the NFT. My founding partner and I have always wanted to donate personally to the Growing Bank but did not have the funds to do so as some of our royalties go back to our holders and the other portions are used to create utility tools or create our art collabs. We will use partial of the grant money to add more funding to the growing bank for our holders. \n\n- Mamba Trade\n   - As mentioned before, Seigami is creating a whole new tool. This tool is basically a public sniper that takes on chain listings and feeds it through a live feed backed by our own in-house node which will be costly to host. This is just the start as that will be Version 1 and we will probably work towards a Marketplace if and only if things go well. Originally the team wanted to release \"Seitension\" which was a tool that will improve your experience trading on Pallet. This idea then turned into Mamba Trade. This sniper will take a few months to build since there will be alot of work behind a project like this. The funds from the grant, if accepted, will go towards creating this tool for the SEI Ecosystem. ",

        "answer": "\n### Phase 1: Content Creation and Social Growth\n\n**Description**: This phase focuses on continuously producing web3 content such as animations, stories, live streams, and exploring various media formats like spaces and podcasts. It involves providing tools and resources to the community and other SEI projects, fostering education and community building. The aim is to experiment with decentralized creativity, enabling community-driven content creation. Initial funding will support content production, subscriptions, licensing, AI tools for efficient production, and paying creators.\n\n**Key Milestones**:\n- **Content  Creation and Experimentation**: Launch initial set of web3 content (animations, stories, live streams).\n- **Community Engagement and Feedback**: Conduct live streams and community events to gather feedback.\n- **Expansion into New Media Formats**: Explore spaces, podcasts, and other formats.\n- **Supply SEI Projects with Tools**: Provide animation and illustration tools, such as rigs, to SEI projects and the community, helping them create their own content and achieve their goals.\n\n**Grant Use**: Funding for content production, animation resources, live streaming equipment, marketing and outreach, community event organization, equipment, software, production costs, and providing tools to the SEI community.\n\n### Phase 2: Collaborations and Onboarding\n\n**Description**: This phase aims to collaborate with web2 and traditional media projects, featuring them in content to onboard their audiences. It focuses on building relationships and partnerships to bring SEI lore and characters to new places, expanding the community. Funding will be used for partnership development, collaborative content production, and outreach.\n\n**Key Milestones**:\n- **SEI Partnerships**: Collaborate with SEI projects to create joint content and onboard new audiences.\n- **Web3 Partnerships**: Partner with web3 projects to expand the community beyond SEI.\n- **Web2 and Beyond**: Engage with web2 and traditional media projects to bring their audiences into web3.\n\n**Grant Use**: Funding for partnership development, content production costs, outreach and engagement, integration tools, marketing, and onboarding resources.\n\n### Phase 3: Platform Development\n\n**Description**: The goal of this phase is to design and develop the Crossover platform to facilitate decentralized creativity and community engagement. It includes launching a beta version to gather user feedback and refine features, followed by the official launch with full functionality and robust community features. Funding will support the design, development, testing, and promotion of the platform.\n\n**Key Milestones**:\n- **Platform Design and Development**: Create the initial design and begin development of the Crossover platform.\n- **Beta Launch and Testing**: Launch beta version of the platform, including community engagement tools and blockchain integration.\n- **Full Platform Launch and Growth**: Officially launch the Crossover platform, with full functionality and robust community features.\n\n**Grant Use**: Funding for hiring developers, UI/UX designers, and project managers, continued development, beta testing, user feedback collection, final development costs, marketing and promotion, and ongoing community support.\n\n### Timeline & Viability\n\nThe timeline for these phases is highly dependent on potential funding offers. No funding means slower and bootstrapped, funding support means speed and potential higher scalability.  Each phase is designed to progress simultaneously, with priority given to content creation and social growth, followed by collaborations and onboarding, and finally, platform development. This phased approach ensures that each area can be developed effectively, driving user adoption and participation within the SEI community and beyond.\n\n**Phase 2+3 are mostly stretch goals via funding**: In the early stages of the project and without significant funding, the development of a comprehensive platform wouldn't be feasible. However, it is where we aim to get to. We believe we have the expertise and experience to create an innovative onboarding platform for the creator economy that isn't based on turbulent memecoins but instead on sustainable earning mechanisms for creators and audiences alike.\n",

But Creed NFTs are more than just beautiful collectibles; they're gateway tools designed to empower users and navigate the Sei ecosystem with confidence.\n\nUtilities: \n\nCreed NFTs offer a phased development roadmap with a clear focus on utility and fostering trust within the Sei network:\n\n•The King Seer: This market analysis tool (currently in manual operation) will transition into an AI-powered dashboard, providing valuable insights for informed decision-making on Sei NFTs/defi alpha opportunities. Imagine having your own in-house market guru!\n\n• IVSS (Identity Verification Scoring System): This creditworthiness assessment tool (under development) aims to benefit DeFi lenders by promoting trust and reducing risks within the Sei NFT and DeFi space. It will seamlessly integrate with existing DeFi platforms, making it readily accessible to Creed NFT holders.\n\n• Secure Escrow Platform: Utilizing the IVSS, we plan to create a secure escrow system fostering trust between project founders, artists/developers, and collectors within the Sei ecosystem.\n\n``Beyond the Collection:``\n\nOwning a Creed NFT unlocks exclusive perks, including:\n\n• Collaborative Art Projects:  Creed NFT holders gain the opportunity to collaborate on art projects with our talented artist.\n• Game Design Discounts:   For game design enthusiasts, holding a Creed NFT might unlock potential discounts on courses for designing awesome game characters.\n\n•Seeking Your Collaboration:\n\nWe are currently at a crucial stage in development and are seeking a Gitcoin X SEI FND grant to accelerate the creation of these valuable tools. Your support will directly contribute to the growth of the Sei network by:\n\n• Empowering NFT users with market analysis and secure transactions.\n• Attracting new lenders and borrowers to the Sei DeFi ecosystem.\n• Increasing loan activity and overall DeFi adoption within Sei.\n• Reducing risks and fostering trust within the NFT and DeFi space on Sei.\n\n**Investing in the Future:**\n\nBy supporting Creed NFTs, you're not just funding an NFT collection; you're investing in the future of the Sei network, fostering a secure and thriving DeFi environment for everyone. We are a dedicated team committed to making a positive impact, and your partnership in this endeavor would be invaluable.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWe believe in the power of collaboration, and your support would be a significant step forward in our mission to empower users and build a more secure and trusted Sei network.

This leverages existing networks and increases outreach.\n\n• Interactive AMAs: Hosting Ask Me Anything sessions with the development team and artist to foster transparency, answer questions, and generate excitement around the project.\n\nOur Long-Term Strategy:\n\n• Continuous Improvement of The King Seer Tool: Based on user feedback and market trends, The Market analysis and report curation tool will undergo phased development, adding new features and functionalities to solidify its position as the premier NFT market analysis tool on Sei.\n\n• SeinergydotFi Exploration: Our vision for the future extends beyond The Creed NFTs. We plan to actively explore integrating Creed NFTs with Defi partnerships and platforms, leveraging the Identity Verification & Security System (IVSS) and secure escrow system currently under development this stage will be very important to our upcoming DeFi project, SeinergydotFi. This potential integration could enable seamless functionality, enhance user experience, and promote informed decision-making within the broader Sei DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThese initiatives demonstrate our commitment to building a thriving Creed NFT community and fostering a secure, user-friendly environment within the Sei network, with an eye towards future innovation through SeinergydotFi.",

        "answer": "Our Roadmap:\n\n•Stage 1 (Completed): We successfully filled our OG and WL roles (85%) through strategic partnerships, giveaways, engaging games, and fostering a strong community spirit. \n\n•Stage 2 (Ongoing): We're continuously expanding our team, nurturing community engagement, and organically growing our presence on Twitter and Discord. This stage also involves pre-mint development to establish compelling value propositions for Creed NFT holders (60% complete).\n\n•Stage 3 (Ongoing): We've finalized collaborations with exciting partners and are currently announcing them to the community (Previously Stage 4). We remain open to exploring additional strategic partnerships that benefit our community.\n\n•Stage 4 (Upcoming): The official mint date will be announced soon (To be determined). \n\n•Stage 5 (Upcoming): Post-mint roadmap details will be unveiled, with a strong emphasis on dApp development:\n\n    •IVSS Development (Identity Verification & Security System) (30% of Grant Allocation): We'll focus on building the core technology powering the Creed NFt and subsequently,  SeinergydotFi. This system will enhance security and trust within the DeFi ecosystem by verifying user shared zero-knowledge proof identities, mitigating bad actors.\n   • Secure Escrow System (20% of Grant Allocation): Developing a secure escrow system will be crucial for facilitating safe peer-to-peer transactions within our NFT marketplace and future DeFi applications.\n\n    NFT Market Analysis & Curation Tool (10% of Grant Allocation):\n\n Building an NFT market analysis and curation tool will empower Creed NFT holders to make informed investment decisions and discover valuable NFT opportunities.\n\n•Stage 6 (Target): We aim to achieve a complete sell-out of the Creed collection and secure a listing on a reputable exchange. Secure holder verification will be implemented using our existing UFO bot within the server.\n\n•Stage 7 (Ongoing):Detailed roadmaps for each development area will be released, building upon the initial outlines in Stage 5. We'll showcase completed phases and continuously update our website for improvement.\n\n•Stage 8 (Future): Upon successful completion of the core dApps, we'll shift focus to the full development and launch of SeinergydotFi, the DeFi platform integrating the IVSS system. \n\n•SeinergydotFi Development on Hold (Transparency)\n\nThe development of SeinergydotFi, initially planned as StakeSynergy, is currently paused due to unforeseen circumstances surrounding the founder of a previous affiliation. We prioritize the success of The Creed NFT project to ensure a strong foundation for the future DeFi platform. We remain committed to the long-term vision of SeinergydotFi and will resume development when possible considering we already have a whitepaper documented.\n\nGrant Utilization:\n\nIf awarded the Gitcoin grant, the funds will be strategically allocated to accelerate our progress and achieve key milestones within the proposed timeline:\n\n• Community Building (15%): Resources will be directed towards hosting engaging community events, rewarding active members who participate in partnership announcements, and expanding our reach through targeted marketing efforts.\n\n• Art & Development (60%): A significant portion of the grant will compensate the creation of high-quality NFT artwork and the development of innovative dApps including the IVSS, secure escrow system, and NFT market analysis tool.\n\n• Team Support (20%): A portion of the grant will be used to compensate and retain skilled team members who are crucial for project execution.\n\n•Marketing & Outreach (5%): We'll leverage the grant to amplify marketing efforts strategically, focusing on securing partnerships that align with our dApp development goals. \n\nBy effectively utilizing the Gitcoin grant, we're confident in achieving our roadmap milestones efficiently and delivering a truly valuable NFT experience with long-term utility for The Creed community.\n\n~Transparency & Communication~\n\n We are committed to transparent communication throughout our journey. We will regularly update the community on progress, address challenges openly, and adapt our roadmap based on valuable feedback.\n\nThank you for your consideration.",

People who have the enabled Holder role can check in to the Dao within discord with a simple /Check-in command providing their wallets and socials.

It connects people who are working on exciting projects with those who are interested in learning about and supporting these projects.\n\nExample: Imagine you're a blockchain developer with a new project. SeiStart helps you get noticed by others who might want to follow your progress, give feedback, or even contribute to your project.\n\nShowcasing Influencers\nSeiStart gives influencers a platform to share their knowledge and grow their audience. Influencers get their own dedicated pages where they can post updates, share insights, and interact with their followers.\n\nExample: Your favorite crypto influencer can share their latest thoughts on DeFi, helping you stay informed while they gain more followers and build their reputation.\n\nEasy Access to Resources\nSeiStart acts as a one-stop shop for all the resources related to a project.

By participating and contributing valuable content, users can earn points that can be redeemed for special perks.\n\nExample: An influencer who regularly posts insightful updates and engages with followers might earn points that give them extra visibility or exclusive access to new features.\n\nRandom Project Discovery\nSeiStart has a fun feature that lets you discover new projects randomly based on your interests. It’s like a “surprise me” button that helps you find new and exciting projects you might not have otherwise encountered.\n\nExample: If you're into gaming projects, hitting the random discovery button might introduce you to a new blockchain game that's gaining traction.\n\nCommunity-Driven Content\nSeiStart encourages users to upload and share content, making the platform rich with user-generated information. This ensures that the content is always relevant and up-to-date.\n\nExample: Community members can add FAQs, share how-to guides, or upload project updates, keeping the information fresh and useful for everyone.\n\nReal-Life Examples:\nFor a Developer: You can list your new Sei project on SeiStart, attract followers, get feedback, and maybe even find collaborators to help you build it.\n\nFor an Influencer: You get a dedicated page to share your expertise, engage with your followers, and grow your audience, all while earning rewards for your contributions.\n\nFor a Newcomer: You can easily explore different projects, learn from the resources provided, and stay updated with the latest trends in the blockchain space.",

Influencer Partnerships\nWe’ll partner with well-known influencers in the blockchain space. These influencers will promote SeiStart, share their experiences, and create content on the platform.\n\nExample: Imagine your favorite blockchain YouTuber sharing a tutorial on SeiStart, explaining how to use the platform and showcasing its benefits. Their followers are likely to join to get more of their content and interact with them.\n\n2. Rewards and Incentives\nTo keep users active, we’ll offer rewards for various actions on the platform. This can include creating content, engaging with posts, or inviting friends.\n\nExample: Users might earn points for every new project they follow, which they can later exchange for exclusive perks, such as early access to new features or enhanced profile visibility.\n\n3. Community Events\nWe’ll organize online events like hackathons, webinars, and Q&A sessions with project leaders and influencers. These events will foster community interaction and learning.\n\nExample: A monthly Q&A session where users can ask questions directly to the developers of their favorite projects or to influencers who are experts in the field.\n\n4. Content Creation Contests\nTo encourage high-quality content, we’ll host contests where users can submit articles, videos, or tutorials about blockchain projects or technology. Winners will get featured on the platform and receive rewards.\n\nExample: A contest for the best tutorial on how to create a decentralized app (dApp), with the winner receiving a prize and having their tutorial featured prominently on SeiStart.\n\n5. Easy Onboarding\nWe’ll ensure the onboarding process is simple and user-friendly. New users will receive a welcome guide and have access to tutorials that help them navigate and utilize the platform effectively.\n\nExample: A new user signing up will get a step-by-step tutorial on how to set up their profile, follow projects, and start engaging with the community.\n\n6. Exclusive Access and Previews\nActive users will get exclusive access to new features, beta tests, and previews of upcoming projects. This makes them feel valued and more connected to the platform.\n\nExample: Users who consistently contribute high-quality content might get early access to a new feature that allows for live streaming project updates.\n\n7. Social Media Integration\nWe’ll leverage social media to promote user-generated content and events. By sharing highlights and success stories, we’ll draw more users to the platform.\n\nExample: Highlighting a user’s comprehensive project review on our social media channels, which can drive traffic to their profile and to SeiStart.\n\n8. Personalized Recommendations\nUsing tags and user activity, SeiStart will recommend projects and content tailored to each user’s interests, keeping them engaged and discovering new things.\n\nExample: If you’re interested in DeFi projects, SeiStart will suggest new and trending DeFi projects for you to check out, making the discovery process exciting and relevant.",

We want to design a platform that allowed users to submit $Sei/$Seiwhale to a contract that is locked up and only released once a winner is chosen. The Dapp will provide the users with an on chain # generated in an NFT format as proof of entry. Users will be allowed to submit multiple times to increase their odds of winning. The Dapp will announce a winning numbers on a weekly basis, if a winner is not chosen the funds will remained lock in contract allowing the pool to to grow. Once a winner is chosen , they will receive 90% of the funds and Seiwhale Production gets paid the remaining 10% as royalties. The Dapp will reset the pool and entries once the money has been sent out and begin a new lottery game.  For our bot upgrade we will like to add a sport betting feature.

We are committed and active within the community, constantly engaging with our members to create a vibrant atmosphere.\n\nEngagement and Rewards:\n\nTill date we have run lots of fun contests like Quiz contests, Poop Hunt Contest, Raider Mafia Contest and also distributed free SEI tokens to our members. \n\nBy hosting free contests and rewarding participation with SEI tokens, we aim to create a habit of daily engagement and foster a positive community experience. \n\nOur viral strategies, combined with support from the SEI Foundation and key figures, will help amplify our reach and impact.\n",

A lighthearted and humorous approach can make learning about NFTs and the SEI network more fun and approachable for a wider audience.\n\nWe are not focusing on building new tools at this point, as other NFT projects are already doing that.

We aim to achieve this by organizing games on our Discord channel, rewarding participants with SEI tokens.\n\nStrategy:\nTo draw more users into the SEI ecosystem, we propose the following approach:\n\nFree Entries:\n\nOpen to everyone with smaller SEI rewards.\nDesigned to attract new participants and introduce them to the SEI ecosystem.\nNFT Holders Only:\n\nExclusive to those holding our NFTs.\nOffers higher rewards to incentivize ownership and deepen engagement within our community.\n\nEngagement Plan:\nOur goal is to make daily participation a habit for our users. We will host games on Discord where participants can win SEI tokens. To claim their rewards, they will share their achievements on Twitter, promoting both SEI and our NFT project to a broader audience. This approach will ensure continuous visibility and attract new users to SEI every day.\n\n\nTimeline:\n\nFirst 3 Months: We will run free contests on Discord and Twitter to build a habit of daily engagement and rewards among our users.\nAfter 3 Months: We will launch a website focused on education and collaboration with SEI projects, further enhancing user engagement and knowledge.\nCurrent Progress and Request:\nSo far, we have successfully organized initial free contests from our own resources, demonstrating the potential of our approach. We have funded everything out of our pockets, driven by our passion and commitment, not profit. Our goal has always been to build a successful and thriving community, not to make money.\n\nVision:\nWe believe that by offering free SEI tokens, we can attract significant attention to the SEI ecosystem. This low-barrier entry will encourage many new users to join. Additionally, we plan to collaborate with new projects on SEI, spreading awareness and driving adoption.\n\nCommitment:\nDespite the challenges of the bear market, we have remained active and committed to our project. We are determined to continue our efforts and believe that with the SEI Foundation's assistance, we can achieve our ambitious goals.\n\nWe have a clear roadmap and a strong community, but we need your help to scale and make a substantial impact. By supporting us, you are not just investing in a project, but in the growth and vibrancy of the entire SEI ecosystem. ",

The gamified experience and potential for earning rewards incentivize users to actively participate in the platform, driving adoption and increasing overall activity on the Sei network.\n\nShowcasing Sei's capabilities: Gokucity demonstrates the power and flexibility of the Sei blockchain by building a complex, interactive platform that combines smart contracts, random number generation, and token management. The project highlights Sei's ability to support high-performance decentralized applications, attracting more developers and projects to the ecosystem.\n\nFostering community and partnerships: Through its Lootballz calendar and partnership initiatives, Gokucity actively collaborates with other projects and influencers within the Sei community. These partnerships not only provide value to Gokucity users in the form of exclusive rewards and utility for NFT holders, but also help strengthen the overall Sei community by encouraging cross-project collaboration and shared growth.\n\nContributing to Sei's DeFi ecosystem: As a meme token platform with a unique token distribution model, Gokucity adds diversity to Sei's DeFi landscape. The platform's focus on user engagement and gamification complements other DeFi projects on Sei, providing users with a wider range of opportunities to participate in decentralized finance.\n\nGenerating transaction volume and liquidity: The frequent buying, selling, and burning of GOKU tokens required for participating in the Lootballz system contribute to increased transaction volume and liquidity on Sei's decentralized exchanges. This activity helps support the broader Sei economy and benefits other projects and users within the ecosystem.\n\nPromoting Sei to new audiences: Gokucity's meme-inspired branding and social media presence have the potential to attract new audiences to the Sei blockchain.
