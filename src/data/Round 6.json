Some of the devs denied us but I totally understand, I'm a newbie. But there are also people who are willing to take risks just to give me a chance. I don't put hate to those who did not help me, I am not their obligation, but once I am able to grow bigger, my goal is to help newbies too. Just want to add DYOR notice promotion per se. Everyone started from scratch, trust is hard to gain nowadays, but if no one is going to give even a little trust to someone new asking for help, how are you be able to say you are a successful person because you made it by yourself, if you don't have the heart to share the gift of knowledge and gift of trust to someone who needs to be heard? A community will grow, someone will be a user, someone will be a builder, but if you inspired someone to do something like you did, bring them up, let them be heard, that is one of our main goals. It might be risky if you don't let the people know DYOR, but getting to know the person first very well would let your gut say, \"I will help you don't worry\". Anyway, have a good day!",

On the other hand, by skillfully integrating Sei's functions and applications into the game scenarios, users can truly experience the value that Sei brings during the entertainment process, such as efficient trading experiences, secure asset storage, etc. This truly enables the value of Sei to be fully realized in users' actual operations.

Promote On - chain Interaction\nWe are committed to vigorously promoting on - chain interaction by optimizing smart contracts and developing diverse DApps. Since the implementation of relevant optimization measures, the average daily number of transactions on the Sei chain has increased significantly, which intuitively reflects a remarkable improvement in users' enthusiasm for participating in on - chain activities. At the same time, the monthly active user number of DApps has also increased, reaching 100,000. This not only proves the effectiveness of our efforts but also indicates that the activity level of the Sei ecosystem is constantly rising.\n\n### 2. Improve User Acquisition and Retention (UAW)\nTo enhance user acquisition and retention, we have carefully planned a series of user incentive activities, such as transaction cashbacks and invitation rewards. After the launch of these activities, the number of new user registrations increased to 100,000 within one month. In addition, this has injected a continuous stream of vitality into the Sei ecosystem.\n\nWe believe that Sei's fast transaction speed and low gas fees have great advantages in attracting game users. Our efforts in on - chain interaction, as well as user acquisition and retention, have given full play to these characteristics of Sei, creating a favorable user experience for game users. This has attracted more game users to choose and stay in the Sei ecosystem, effectively promoting the overall development of the ecosystem.",

In our future plans, we have formulated a detailed roadmap to continuously develop a series of brand - new projects that are highly compatible with the Sei ecosystem. These new projects will not only build on our past success but also achieve breakthroughs in technological innovation, user experience enhancement, and ecosystem expansion.\n\nWe firmly believe that through close cooperation and joint development with the Sei ecosystem, we can bring a continuous stream of vitality and value to the entire ecosystem.

Here’s how we differentiate ourselves:\n\n1. Speed and Scalability Optimized for DeFi\nSei Network's unique optimizations make our project incredibly fast, providing ultra-low latency and seamless order execution. Unlike other DeFi platforms on Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain, Sei’s architecture enables quick transaction finality and cost-efficient trading, giving users an edge in high-frequency markets.\n2. Tailored for Professional and Retail Traders\nOur project combines features usually reserved for centralized exchanges with the security and transparency of a decentralized platform. This dual approach attracts both retail traders looking for simplicity and professional traders seeking advanced features like limit orders, stop-loss functions, and market depth visualization.\n3. Liquidity Integration and Aggregation\nWe provide enhanced liquidity by integrating with other DeFi liquidity sources within the Sei ecosystem, ensuring deep liquidity even in volatile market conditions. Our liquidity aggregation technology minimizes slippage, offering users better trade execution compared to other decentralized exchanges.\n4. Seamless Onboarding & Education\nWe recognize that new users often face challenges in understanding DeFi, so our project includes a built-in educational hub on the platform. Users can easily access tutorials, FAQs, and market insights to ensure smooth onboarding, making DeFi more approachable.\n5. Transparent & Community-Centric Model\nOur platform is built with a community-first approach, ensuring transparent governance via DAO structures and regular communication with users. We incorporate user feedback into regular updates, allowing the community to have a say in how our project evolves.\n6. Integration with Sei’s Ecosystem\nBy integrating tightly with the Sei ecosystem, our project benefits from Sei’s proof-of-stake consensus, fast block times, and low transaction fees, allowing users to experience a more efficient, cheaper, and secure trading experience.\nHow It Enhances the User Experience on Sei:\nFaster Trades: With Sei’s high throughput and low latency, trading on our project is faster than on other blockchains, ensuring that users don't miss market opportunities.\nLower Fees: Thanks to Sei’s optimized architecture, our project offers minimal transaction fees, making it more affordable for users, especially those making frequent trades.\nSecurity & Transparency: Leveraging Sei’s robust infrastructure, our project ensures complete transparency in transactions, providing users with the trust and security they need for their DeFi activities.\nOur project isn't just another DeFi platform; it's built to capitalize on Sei’s strengths and optimize the trading experience for both newcomers and seasoned traders alike.",
